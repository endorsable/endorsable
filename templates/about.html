  You are not just a number. But you knew that already.
  The problem is that the people who are looking for you can only find you by numbers.
  That means unless you follow the rules precisely, they're missing out on what you can provide.
  They don't see what drives you, your passion, how you're able to make others smile or 
  keep going when the going gets tough. They get thousands of resumes a day, and they sift
  through it with primative tools that boils you down to a single number. 
  If you pass that, only then would they give your credentials a read.

  Endorsable is not like that. Our platform wants to reduce you to many numbers.
  More importantly, we are trying to model who you are professionally by analyzing
  thousands of data points provided by the people who know you best: your coworkers.
  Our hope is that we can represent who you are in a format that makes it easy for the
  people that are looking for you to actually find you. Your skills, your talents,
  your charisma, your personality is really what these people need to figure out if
  you're the one you're looking for, not just whether you can write a few pages that
  checks a few boxes in some computer software somewhere. 
  
  This is our goal. If you are tired of feeling looked over and undervalued, or are
  looking to differentiate yourself, we hope you will join us on our mission.

  Endorsable is a different kind of company. Yes, we need your data to do what we do.
  However, the majority of the code we use to do it is available open-source.
  Our closed-source tools are there to help companies find you, if you ask for it.
  We don't make money from selling your data to third parties.
  Our income is based solely on how you use our platform, and whether you want us
  to make you available to oppurtunities from third parties.
  Consider us a matchmaking service. 
  You pay us to help you find the right job at the right time to make you happy.
  If you have questions or concerns, please contact us.
