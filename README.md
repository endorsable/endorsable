<!-- IDEAS:
contract is:
"reputation"
you start with a small amount
it increases slowly over time (perhaps proportional to your overall skill levels)
	no cap, but still scarce
you have to "spend" some to give someone else an endorsement
but endorsements from others increases your reputation so you can give more endorsements

if reputation were true value (e.g. monetary) that would mean you have incentive to give

however, if you spend reputation and the endorsement is rejected, it disappears as a wasted effort
(and as a waste of reputation == value), so incentive not to give bad endorsements

endorsements are public and trusted, so peoeple can use them to find trusted and endorsed skilled workers, is this enough value to "pay" into the system to begin with?

IVO - initial value offering

you're getting a higher "reputation" for less money up front, idea is that the value of reputation goes up (or the value stays constant or tied to something else, but your quantity goes up over time. users must have "Skin in the game" from the get go

we get a small cut of each transactional exchange of reputation, and then companies can pay for our expertise in filtering the blockchain of people's skills.

your name, or some other non-contact but personally identifiable piece of information must be tied to the contract? or.... you have control to tell a private party who you are/how to get in contact with you, and you are the gatekeeper for asking your endorsers whether they want to reveal their identity too. perhaps there is a reputation boost for this action?

problems:
people are going to do more stupid shit right out of the gate, how do we de-incentivize this?
how do we increase value over time
	"Cash out" your reputation literally for Ether
	Pay to play

reputation and skill quantity (the metric of how much skill you have total, not what types perhaps a hash of the skills you have or something? salting?)
is managed in the public blockchain for this app, and users build private blockchains between each other, or in smaller groups (or look in to that Raiden thing?) and they can release that data to interested parties?


the public blockchain need not show "too much" about our system, only how the duality of reputation and skill feed on each other, e.g. Alan's idea of dual tokens where reputation is the value store and competency (skill level) is the value creator. Productivity, not competency builds reputation. Productivity x Compentency = Value obtained ==> reputation is a collective measurement of value

The private blockchains being built have value towards end-user customers who want to review a user's experiences

Client code (the dapp) need not have open source code, or at least the game system/data processing remain core IP... Maybe clients communicate to us their findings (mining private data?), and we process that on our server into the public blockchain for all to see.

Customers pay us a fee to convert endorsements into skill points through our contract, that's how we make money. The more people use it, the more we make

The safest way to store the interactions would be to have the receiver of the endorsement store the value. The sender must sign off on it as a last step when it is committed.
